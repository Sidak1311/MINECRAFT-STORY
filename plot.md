Once upon a time, Notch was making a game called 'Minecraft'. Once it was complete the game was a huge success. Notch was very happy but he did not know that there was a bug in the game. This bug was known as Herobrine. 
Later on, Notch gets reports about players losing their worlds for a mob which the players named 'Herobrine. Notch starts to look in the code but when he runs it, there are no bugs. He thinks that there is a staff member on his team who is 'Herobrine'.
